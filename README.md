# Swaranjali Music Classes (React)

A small React single-page site for Swaranjali Music Classes. This repository uses Create React App, Tailwind (via the CLI), and i18next for translations. The project contains sections: Navbar, Home (hero), About, Exams, Gallery, Family, Contact and Footer.

## Quick status / recent changes
- Home page has been simplified to a full-screen hero (`src/components/Home.jsx`) that uses `src/images/SMC.jpg` as a background image (absolutely-positioned `img` with `object-cover`) and starts visually below the fixed navbar.
- The Slider component was removed (no `src/components/Slider.jsx` present). If you previously had a slider, it was replaced with a stable hero to avoid layout shifts.
- i18n (English/Hindi) is wired under `src/locales/` and initialized in `src/i18n.js`.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS recommended) and npm installed.
- PowerShell is the default shell on Windows — commands below assume PowerShell.

Check versions:
```powershell
node -v
npm -v
```

## Install dependencies
From the project root:

```powershell
npm install
```

Note: Previously there were peer-dependency errors when installing certain packages (i18next/react-i18next). If npm reports ERESOLVE peer dependency conflicts, re-run with `--legacy-peer-deps`:

```powershell
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Development (run locally)
1. Start Tailwind watcher (in a separate terminal):
```powershell
npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch
```
This will (re)generate `src/output.css` from `src/input.css`. Keep this running while developing.

2. Start the React dev server:
```powershell
npm start
```
If port 3000 is in use, CRA will prompt to use the next available port (e.g. 3001). Accept the prompt and open the printed URL.

If the app doesn't start, paste the full terminal output here and I'll help diagnose.

## Build for production

```powershell
npm run build
```

This produces a `build/` folder ready for deployment.

## Project structure (important files)
- `src/` — application source
	- `index.js` — app entry (imports `output.css` and `index.css`)
	- `i18n.js` — i18next initialization
	- `locales/en/translation.json`, `locales/hi/translation.json` — translations
	- `components/`
		- `Navbar.jsx` — fixed top navbar (has scroll `offset={-80}` for anchor links)
		- `Home.jsx` — hero section (uses `src/images/SMC.jpg`)
		- `About.jsx`, `Exams.jsx`, `Gallery.jsx`, `Family.jsx`, `Contact.jsx`, `Footer.jsx`
- `src/images/` — images and videos used by the site
- `src/input.css` — Tailwind entry file
- `src/output.css` — compiled Tailwind (generated by the CLI)

## How to change the Home hero image or height
- Image: replace `src/images/SMC.jpg` with your image (same filename) or edit `src/components/Home.jsx` to import a different file.
- Height: `Home.jsx` uses `className="h-[90vh] md:h-screen"` on the root section. Edit those classes to change the hero height (for example `h-[80vh] md:h-screen`).
- Navbar offset: the Navbar uses `offset={-80}` in react-scroll links and the hero image is shifted by `top: 80px` to align just below the navbar. If your navbar height is different, update both values accordingly.

## Removing or re-adding a slider
- The Slider component was intentionally removed to avoid layout instability. If you want a slider later, you can either:
	- Recreate a lightweight slider component (using CSS/JS or a library like `swiper`), or
	- Ask me to add a simple, responsive slider and I can implement it.

## Troubleshooting
- "Page not coming / dev server exit code 1": run `npm start` and paste the full terminal output here. Common causes:
	- Missing dependency or a compile error: terminal will show file and line.
	- Port already in use: CRA will ask to use another port — accept the prompt.
	- Peer dependency / install errors: re-run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`.

- Browser shows a blank page but terminal shows "Compiled successfully": open browser DevTools (F12) → Console. Copy any red errors (they indicate runtime errors).

## Contributing
- Branch from `main` (or master) and open PR with clear description.
- Keep changes small and focused (component per PR).

## Need help?
If something still doesn't work locally, tell me which step failed (install, `npm start`, build) and paste the terminal output or screenshot. I can run the commands here and fix code as needed.
